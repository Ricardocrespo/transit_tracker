/// Expands a bounding box around a central coordinate by a specified radius.
///
/// This function calculates a rectangular bounding box around the given
/// `center` coordinate by offsetting it in the cardinal directions (north,
/// south, east, and west) by the specified `meters` distance. The default
/// radius is 1000 meters, which is a common value for geospatial queries.
///
/// The function uses the `Distance` class to compute the offsets, ensuring
/// accurate geodesic calculations.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [center]: The central coordinate around which the bounding box is expanded.
/// - [meters]: The radius in meters to expand the bounding box. Defaults to 1000.
///
/// Returns:
/// A `LatLngBounds` object representing the expanded bounding box.
